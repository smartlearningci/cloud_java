    "## 0) API Gateway — what it is, why it’s used, AWS/Azure mapping, and how it differs from a Load Balancer\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1 What is an API Gateway (cloud context)\n",
    "An **API Gateway** is the **single north–south entry point** for your system’s APIs. It:\n",
    "- **Receives** client requests (web, mobile, integrations).\n",
    "- **Applies policies**: authentication/authorization, API keys, **rate limiting**/throttling, CORS.\n",
    "- **Transforms** requests/responses: rewrite paths/headers, normalize payloads.\n",
    "- **Routes** each call to the correct service and can **version** APIs (v1, v2…).\n",
    "- **Observes**: health/metrics, per‑route logging, dashboards.\n",
    "- **Decouples** clients from internal services (names/ports/topology).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **In Phase 1** we implement this role with **Spring Cloud Gateway (SCG)** — lightweight, didactic, and ideal for local/on‑prem execution.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2 Why use an API Gateway now\n",
    "- **Single entry** → clients call `http://host:8080/api/**` instead of discovering each service.\n",
    "- **Consistency** → common headers, CORS, error shapes, and versioning in one place.\n",
    "- **Minimal security** → in this MVP, **X‑API‑KEY** (optional); later IAM/JWT/TLS/rate‑limit.\n",
    "- **Controlled evolution** → swap/replicate services without breaking clients.\n",
    "- **Observability** → health/logs per route; later metrics/tracing.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.3 What we implement **now** with Spring Cloud Gateway\n",
    "- **Route:** `/api/tasks/**` → `tasks-service:8081`  \n",
    "- **API key (optional):** if env var `API_KEY` exists in the gateway process, header `X-API-KEY` is **required** (missing/wrong → **401**).  \n",
    "  Without `API_KEY`, the gateway runs in **open mode** (dev/demo).  \n",
    "- **Observability:** `GET /actuator/health` (UP/DOWN).\n",
    "\n",
    "🔗 **Twelve‑Factor touchpoints:** **#7 Port Binding**, **#3 Config**, **#5 Build/Release/Run**, **#6 Processes (stateless)**, **#10 Dev/Prod parity**, **#11 Logs**, **#9 Disposability**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.4 Mapping this to **AWS** (forward‑looking; not implemented here)\n",
    "- **Managed equivalent:** **AWS API Gateway** (REST/HTTP API) as the **public entry**.  \n",
    "- **Typical backends:** **ALB** in front of **ECS/EKS** (containers) or direct to **Lambda/ALB**.  \n",
    "- **Policies:** API Keys, **JWT/OAuth2** with **Cognito**, throttling/quotas, WAF.  \n",
    "- **Observability:** **CloudWatch** logs/metrics, X‑Ray for tracing.  \n",
    "- **Analogy to our MVP:** what SCG does (route + API key) maps to API Gateway policies (keys/authorizers) targeting a backend (ALB/ECS/EKS).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.5 Mapping this to **Azure** (forward‑looking; not implemented here)\n",
    "- **Managed equivalent:** **Azure API Management (APIM)** as public entry.  \n",
    "- **Typical backends:** **App Service**, **AKS**, **Container Apps**, **Application Gateway**.  \n",
    "- **Policies:** subscription keys, **JWT/OAuth2** via **Microsoft Entra ID**, rate‑limit, rewrite, cache, transformations.  \n",
    "- **Observability:** **Azure Monitor/Log Analytics**, optional Developer Portal.  \n",
    "- **Analogy to our MVP:** APIM policy (subscription key/JWT) → backend in AKS/Apps; same conceptual shape as SCG → `tasks-service`.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.6 **Load Balancer** — what it is and how it differs from the Gateway\n",
    "A **Load Balancer (LB)** distributes traffic across **instances** of the same service. It focuses on:\n",
    "- **Balancing** (round‑robin, least‑connections…), **health checks**, **failover**.\n",
    "- Terminating **TLS** and operating at L4 (TCP) or L7 (HTTP), but it’s **not** an API governance layer.\n",
    "- It **does not** manage API versioning, rich API keys, rate‑limit policies, or payload transformations.\n",
    "\n",
    "**Examples:**\n",
    "- **AWS**: **ALB/NLB** (Application/Network LB).  \n",
    "- **Azure**: **Application Gateway** (L7), **Azure Load Balancer** (L4).\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Common pattern:** put an **API Gateway** in front and an **LB** behind (gateway → LB → services/containers).  \n",
    "> In our MVP, the **SCG gateway** is the entry point; **balancing** is not needed yet.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.7 Summary table (Gateway vs Load Balancer)\n",
