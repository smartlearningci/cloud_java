    "> **Goal:** place the **Gateway** in front of `tasks-service`, validate routing `/api/tasks/**`, and enable **optional Xâ€‘APIâ€‘KEY** security.  \n",

    "## 0) What is an **API Gateway** in cloud context (and what we implement here)\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.1 Definition (cloud)\n",
    "An **API Gateway** is the **single northâ€‘south entry point** for a systemâ€™s APIs. It receives client requests and can **apply policies** (authentication, authorization, CORS, rateâ€‘limit), perform **transformations** (headers/path/payload), handle **versioning**, and **route** each call to the right service. It also exposes **observability** (health/metrics) and helps with API governance.\n",
    "\n",
    "> In public clouds we often use **managed services** (e.g., **AWS API Gateway**, **Azure API Management**).  \n",
    "> In this course, for dev/onâ€‘prem, we implement a lightweight gateway using **Spring Cloud Gateway (SCG)**.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 0.2 What we are doing **now** (Phase 1, with Spring Cloud Gateway)\n",
    "- **Single entry point** at `http://localhost:8080` with a route:\n",
    "  - `/api/tasks/**` â†’ forwards to `tasks-service` (port **8081**).\n",
    "- **Minimal security (optional)**:\n",
    "  - If the environment variable **`API_KEY`** is defined for the gateway process, clients **must** send header **`X-API-KEY: <value>`**; otherwise the gateway returns **401**.\n",
    "  - If **`API_KEY`** is **not** defined, the gateway runs in **open mode** (no header required) for dev/demos.\n",
    "- **Observability**:\n",
    "  - Gateway **health** at `/actuator/health` (UP/DOWN).\n",
    "\n",
    "ðŸ”— **12â€‘Factor notes touched here:** **#7 Port Binding**, **#3 Config**, **#5 Build/Release/Run**, **#6 Processes**, **#10 Dev/Prod parity**, **#11 Logs**, **#9 Disposability**.\n",

    "  - Secrets in **AWS Secrets Manager**, identities via **Cognito** (if we evolve to JWT).\n",
