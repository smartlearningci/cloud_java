    "# 📍 Overview — 4 Modules & Solution Evolution (TaskFlow)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Thread through the course: **TaskFlow**, a tiny team task manager used to demonstrate **cloud‑native** architecture step by step.  \n",
    "> Objective: move from a “Hello API” to a **runnable, observable, secure and CI/CD‑ready** base.\n",

    "## Module I — Cloud‑Native Fundamentals + First Artifacts (Phase 0 → Phase 1)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learn**  \n",
    "- Cloud‑native principles (Twelve‑Factor) applied to a real service.  \n",
    "- Simple REST API patterns and **Actuator health**.  \n",
    "- Single entry point with **Gateway** and minimal **X‑API‑KEY** security (optional).  \n",
    "- **Profiles/env vars** and local execution.  \n",
    "- **Docker Compose** to run services (recommended); **STS** to develop/debug (logs, quick iterations).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we build**  \n",
    "- **Phase 0**: `tasks-service` (Spring Boot + H2) with MVP endpoints and `/actuator/health`.  \n",
    "- **Phase 1**: **Gateway** (Spring Cloud Gateway) in front of `tasks-service` → route `/api/tasks/**`.  \n",
    "  When `API_KEY` is present in the gateway environment, header `X-API-KEY` is required.\n",
    "\n",
    "**End state**  \n",
    "- Postman tests: **create/list/update status** always **through the Gateway**.  \n",
    "- Can run with **STS** (didactic) and **Docker Compose** (recommended).\n",
    "\n",
    "**Repo tags**  \n",
    "- `phase-0` (Hello API) → `phase-1` (Gateway + optional X‑API‑KEY).\n",
    "\n",
    "**30‑second talk track**  \n",
    "> “In Module I we lift the TaskFlow API and place a simple gateway in front. We already have health checks, a single entry point and, if we want, an API key. Everything runs locally via STS, and more realistically via Docker Compose.”\n",

    "\n",
    "## Module II — Cloud‑Native Patterns (Config + Discovery + Resilience) (Phase 2)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learn**  \n",
    "- **External configuration** (profiles/env; intro to Config Server).  \n",
    "- **Service discovery** (Eureka) for teaching/dev.  \n",
    "- **Resilience** with Resilience4j: timeouts, retries, circuit breaker.  \n",
    "- Error‑handling and structured logging practices.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we extend**  \n",
    "- Gateway resolves the backend by **discovery** (dev/teaching).  \n",
    "- `tasks-service` adopts **timeouts/retries/circuit breaker** if/when making outbound calls.  \n",
    "- Cleaner per‑environment configuration, ready to evolve to cloud.\n",
    "\n",
    "**End state**  \n",
    "- Compose with 3–4 services (gateway, tasks, config, discovery).  \n",
    "- Demonstrated timeouts/retries/circuit breaker with controlled scenarios.\n",

    "> “Module II adds real cloud‑native patterns: central configs, runtime discovery and resilience for transient failures.”\n",

    "## Module III — Deploy & Data (On‑prem baseline with a path to Cloud) (Phase 3)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learn**  \n",
    "- Move from **H2** to **PostgreSQL** (on‑prem or managed in cloud).  \n",
    "- Drive parameters via **environment variables** (URL/credentials) **without code changes**.  \n",
    "- Deployment topologies: on‑prem with Compose, and how to parameterize for **AWS/Azure** later.\n",
    "\n",
    "> Practical note: in this edition we focus on **on‑prem/Compose**; we show **how** to prepare for cloud (no full rollout here).\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we extend**  \n",
    "- Transparent DB swap: change URL/credentials by env (Twelve‑Factor #3).  \n",
    "- Optional bootstrap/migration conventions when needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "**End state**  \n",
    "- Service runs **with Postgres** (in Docker/Compose or external instance).  \n",
    "- Same API; data **persists** across restarts.\n",
    "\n",
    "**30‑second talk track**  \n",
    "> “Module III takes the API out of the lab: we leave H2 and adopt a real Postgres, configured per‑environment. Same code, only env vars change.”\n",

    "## Module IV — Security, Observability & CI/CD (Phase 4)\n",
    "\n",
    "**What you learn**  \n",
    "- **Security**: from **X‑API‑KEY** to **IAM/JWT**, TLS and secret management.  \n",
    "- **Observability**: metrics/tracing/centralized logs; health/readiness/liveness.  \n",
    "- **CI/CD**: pipeline (e.g., GitHub Actions) with build, tests, image and deploy.  \n",
    "- **Hardening**: rate limiting, least privilege, network policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "**What we extend**  \n",
    "- Gateway with richer policies (real authentication/authorization).  \n",
    "- Integration with secret stores (e.g., Key Vault / Secrets Manager).  \n",
    "- Automated delivery pipeline.\n",
    "\n",
    "**End state**  \n",
    "- A base that is operable and ready to evolve with security, visibility and quality.\n",
