    "> **Scope:** we‚Äôll deploy the **TaskFlow Phase 1** stack (Gateway + tasks‚Äëservice) **on‚Äëprem**.  \n",
    "> We‚Äôll use **Docker Compose** (recommended) and also show how to run from **STS** for development.  \n",

    "- Bring up the **Phase 1** stack (Gateway **8080** ‚Üí tasks‚Äëservice **8081**) on a **local or remote on‚Äëprem** host.\n",
    "- Use **Docker Compose (`run_compose.sh`)** or **STS** to run services.\n",
    "- Configure **optional X‚ÄëAPI‚ÄëKEY** via environment variable and validate routing `/api/tasks/**`.\n",
    "- Check **observability** with `/actuator/health` and basic logs.\n",
    "- Understand **what is safe to expose** publicly (and what is not) in this MVP.\n",

    "- **Git**: phase **tags** keep the class synchronized on milestones.  \n",
    "- **Docker Compose**: easy multi‚Äëservice bring‚Äëup on a single host.  \n",
