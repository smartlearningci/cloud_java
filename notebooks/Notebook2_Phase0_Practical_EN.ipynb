    "- Start the **tasks-service** locally (via **STS** or **Maven**; **Docker** optional).\n",
    "- Confirm it responds on **http://localhost:8081**.\n",
    "- Exercise endpoints: **POST /tasks**, **GET /tasks**, **GET /tasks/{id}**, **PATCH /tasks/{id}/status**.\n",
    "- Verify **observability**: `GET /actuator/health` returns **UP**.\n",
    "- Organize tests with **Postman** (or `curl`).\n",

    "1. **File → Import… → Maven → Existing Maven Projects** → select the project folder.  \n",
    "2. Open the main class (e.g., `…TasksServiceApplication`).  \n",
    "3. **Run As → Spring Boot App**.  \n",
