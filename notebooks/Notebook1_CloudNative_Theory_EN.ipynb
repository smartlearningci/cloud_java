    "# 📘 Notebook 1 — Cloud Native (Theory) + Reference Architecture (conceptual focus)\n",
    "\n",
    "> Goal: establish a common language, link the **Twelve-Factor App** principles to what already exists in **TaskFlow**, and document at a **conceptual** level the **X-API-KEY** security, **observability** (Actuator), and **profiles/env configuration**.  \n",
    "> **No execution or tests here** — hands‑on work happens in **Notebook 2 (Phase 0)** and **Notebook 3 (Gateway / Phase 1)**.\n",

    "## 🎯 Learning outcomes\n",
    "\n",
    "By the end, you should be able to:\n",
    "- Explain Cloud Native through the **12 Factors** and point to **where** each one appears in TaskFlow.\n",
    "- Describe the **domain** and **API contracts (MVP)** of TaskFlow.\n",
    "- Understand **where** the **`X-API-KEY`** is configured (in the **Gateway**) and **how** it behaves.\n",
    "- Understand **what** we expose for **observability** (Actuator) and **why**.\n",
    "- Know the intention of **profiles** and **environment variables** that we will use in the following notebooks.\n",

    "## 1) 🧱 The Twelve-Factor App — from concept to TaskFlow reality\n",
    "\n",
    "> For each factor: **What it is → Phase 0 (now) → Phase 1 (now) → Next phases (Modules II–IV)**\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Codebase — *one codebase, multiple deploys*\n",
    "- **What it is:** one codebase per service; the same code is deployed to multiple environments (dev/test/prod).\n",
    "- **Phase 0:** codebase for `tasks-service` (Spring Boot) versioned and organized by **phases/tags**.\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** the `gateway` enters as an additional service; the **phase/tag** approach continues (e.g., `phase-0`, `phase-1`).\n",
    "- **Next:** new services (e.g., `projects-service`) follow the same pattern.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 2. Dependencies — *explicit and isolated*\n",
    "- **What it is:** declare dependencies in Maven/Gradle; avoid relying on anything “implicit” on the host OS.\n",
    "- **Phase 0:** Spring Boot + Web + Data JPA + H2 declared in `pom.xml` (no hidden/global deps).\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** the gateway adds Spring Cloud Gateway dependencies.\n",
    "- **Next:** add drivers/clients (e.g., PostgreSQL, observability) per profile/environment as needed.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 3. Configuration — *in the environment, not in code*\n",
    "- **What it is:** parameters/secrets via **environment variables** or per‑environment properties; do not hard‑code.\n",
    "- **Phase 0:** profiles drive local behavior (e.g., port, H2).\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** the **Gateway** reads an **API key** from an **environment variable** (name defined in the gateway config). When present, requests must include the `X-API-KEY` header.\n",
    "- **Next:** centralized configuration (e.g., Config Server) and secret management (e.g., Secret Manager/Key Vault).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 4. Backing services — *treat resources as attached services*\n",
    "- **What it is:** DB/queues/caches treated as replaceable resources; swap without code changes.\n",
    "- **Phase 0:** **H2 in‑memory** for rapid development.\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** still H2 for the backend; the gateway just forwards requests.\n",
    "- **Next:** move to **PostgreSQL** (on‑prem/cloud) by changing env/profiles (e.g., connection URL), not code.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 5. Build, Release, Run — *strict separation of stages*\n",
    "- **What it is:** build the artifact, combine with config, then run; stages are distinct and automatable.\n",
    "- **Phase 0:** build and run the `tasks-service`; Docker option separates build/run.\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** orchestrate **gateway + tasks-service** with **Docker Compose**; config remains externalized via env.\n",
    "- **Next:** CI/CD pipeline to formalize build → test → image → deploy.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 6. Processes — *stateless; store state in backing services*\n",
    "- **What it is:** the service does not rely on local disk/session; persistent state belongs to the DB.\n",
    "- **Phase 0:** state in H2; the service does not persist on container disk.\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** same principle; the gateway is stateless (validation/routing only).\n",
    "- **Next:** real persistence with PostgreSQL; external storage for files if/when introduced.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 7. Port binding — *the app exports HTTP by itself*\n",
    "- **What it is:** each service binds to a port and exposes HTTP without an external web server.\n",
    "- **Phase 0:** `tasks-service` exposes HTTP (port **8081**).\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** the **gateway** exposes HTTP (port **8080**) and forwards to **8081**.\n",
    "- **Next:** ingress/load balancer once orchestration is used.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 8. Concurrency — *scale out via the process model*\n",
    "- **What it is:** scale by running more instances rather than stretching a single process.\n",
    "- **Phase 0:** single instance of `tasks-service` in dev.\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** one instance of gateway + one of backend (Compose locally).\n",
    "- **Next:** multiple replicas per service behind the gateway and load‑balancing (when orchestration applies).\n",
    "\n",
    "### 9. Disposability — *fast startup/shutdown; graceful behavior*\n",
    "- **What it is:** quick start/stop; tolerate restarts and failures gracefully.\n",
    "- **Phase 0:** Spring Boot starts fast; graceful shutdown by default.\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** same for the gateway.\n",
    "- **Next:** readiness/liveness for orchestrators; restart policies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 10. Dev/Prod parity — *keep environments as similar as possible*\n",
    "- **What it is:** minimize differences across environments to avoid “works on my machine” issues.\n",
    "- **Phase 0:** profiles (e.g., `dev`) align local behavior.\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** **Docker Compose** aligns a local multi‑service setup.\n",
    "- **Next:** IaC, consistent migrations and parameterization for production.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 11. Logs — *treat logs as event streams*\n",
    "- **What it is:** write to stdout/stderr; external systems aggregate/ship logs.\n",
    "- **Phase 0:** basic Spring Boot logs to stdout.\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** separate logs for gateway and backend.\n",
    "- **Next:** correlation (request‑id), centralization, and structured logs.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 12. Admin processes — *run administrative tasks as one‑off processes*\n",
    "- **What it is:** scripts/migrations/seeds executed separately from the long‑running app.\n",
    "- **Phase 0:** simple dev seed/automation may exist to ease local trials.\n",
    "- **Phase 1:** same approach; the gateway needs no admin tasks.\n",
    "- **Next:** **Flyway** (or similar) migrations and maintenance routines when persistent DB is introduced.\n",
